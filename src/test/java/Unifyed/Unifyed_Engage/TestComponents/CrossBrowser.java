	//as 1st argument, we need to give URL of the BrowserStack and for 2nd we can define all the capabilities in a yml file at project level.
	//copy the yml details from the browserstack documentation "https://automate.browserstack.com/dashboard/v2/quick-start/get-started".
	//Only we create the .yml file now we must include all these details in capability object.

		//include that dependency in pom.xml and we are done.
